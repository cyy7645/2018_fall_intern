I iterated the model for 3 times, they are dmn+, TreeLSTM_DMN+, Batch Based TreeLSTM_DMN+

Introduction of every documents or folders:
TreeLSTM_DMN+_Report_Chinese.docx : includes very detailed introduction of all models, how it developed in Chinese version, it is for Chinese customers.

run_on_gpu_1.ipynb run_on_gpu_2.ipynb : Commands for running on GPU.

data: small pieces of dataset, Google bAbI for the whole one.

dmn+: update version 1 of original model, called DMN+
it includes model, data-preprocessing, log of training and testing.

treelstm_dmn+: update version 2 of original model, called TreeLSTM_DMN+
it includes model, data-preprocessing, log of training and testing.

batch_based_treelstm_dmn+: update version 3 of original model, called Batch Based TreeLSTM_DMN+
It achieves training in a batch on muti-GPU.
it includes model, data-preprocessing, log of training and testing.
